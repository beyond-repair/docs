### Body

<ParamField body="query" type="string" required>
  This is the search term that you want to query for. 
  It can be any kind of text, such as a question, a phrase, or a sentence.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="limit" type="number" default={10}>
  A number that indicates how many results you want to receive at most.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="context_size" type="number" default={0}>
  The maximum number of predecessor and successor chunks to fetch for each result. 
  For example, a value of 2 would fetch two predecessor and two successor chunks for each result. 
  A value of 0 would fetch no context chunks.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="query_processing" type="string" default={"standard"}>
  What level of preprocessing to apply to the query. Valid values are `standard` and `extended`.
  Using `extended` mode will improve the quality of results 
  for queries that are questions or phrases, at the cost of additional latency.
</ParamField>
