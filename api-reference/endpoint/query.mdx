### Body

<ParamField body="query" type="string" required>
  The search term to query for. 
  It can be any kind of text, such as a few keywords, a question, or a phrase.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="limit" type="number" default={10}>
  The maximum number of results to return.
</ParamField>

{/* <ParamField body="context_size" type="number" default={0}>
  The maximum number of predecessor and successor chunks to fetch for each result. 
  For example, a value of 2 would fetch two predecessor and two successor chunks for each result. 
  A value of 0 would fetch no context chunks.
</ParamField> */}

<ParamField body="query_processing" type="string" default={"standard"}>
  What level of preprocessing to apply to the query. Valid values are `standard` and `extended`.
  Using `extended` mode may improve the quality of results 
  for complex queries, at the cost of additional latency.

  <ResponseField name="last_sync_completed_at" type="string">
    Indicates the time at which the last sync (for any of the user's integrations) completed.
