title: "Authentication"

After [obtaining an access token](/auth/flow), you can authenticate with the API by including the token in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

<Warning>
Make sure that you are using the _access token_ for API operations, not the _refresh token_. 
The function of the refresh token is only to obtain new access tokens and to revoke access entirely.
</Warning>
