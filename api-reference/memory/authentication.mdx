title: "Authorization"
---

After [obtaining an API key](/memory/memory#api-keys), you can authorize your API access 
by including the key in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

<Warning>
Make sure that you are using an _API key_ for operations with SID Memory.
Access and refresh tokens obtained from operations with SID Connect will not work.
</Warning>
