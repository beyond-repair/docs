## Overview

## Get Started


### API Keys
To use SID Memory, you'll need to create an account on our [developer dashboard](https://app.sid.ai)
and head over to the [API Keys](https://app.sid.ai/api-keys) page to create a new API key.

Make sure to copy the API key and store it in a safe place, as you won't be able to see it again.

### Call the API
The SID Memory API entirely mirrors the OpenAI API,
so you only need to make minimal changes to start using it.

Most importantly, you need to change the base URL for your requests.
Instead of `POST`ing to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`, you should make your
requests to `https://api.sid.ai/v1/memory/chat/completions` instead.

Additionally, you can control the behaviour of the API by passing additional query parameters (discussed below).

<Warning>
By default, all conversations from requests made through your account are stored in a single database.
To learn how to segment data between your users, see the [Multi-Tenancy](#multi-tenancy) section below.

## Query Parameters
The SID Memory API supports a number of query parameters that allow you to control its behaviour:

### Multi-Tenancy
By default, all conversations are stored in a single database.
This means that if you make your application accessible to multiple users,
conversation data will be shared between them.

To prevent this, the API supports a `namespace` query parameter. Using this parameter,
you can segment conversations into different databases, making sure that each user
only has access to their own conversations.

Generally, you should have a unique user ID for each user, which you can then use as the namespace,
e.g. for a user with ID `user123`, you would make requests to 

```bash
https://api.sid.ai/v1/memory/chat/completions?namespace=user123
```

### Commit Timeout
The `commit_after` query parameter allows you to control after how many seconds a conversation
is considered complete and should be committed to the database.

The default value is `120`, which means that if a particular conversation is inactive for 2 minutes,
it will be committed to the database.

If your application has long breaks between messages, you may want to increase this value.

### Chat ID
By default, the API will use a heuristic to determine which follow-up requests belong to a prior conversation.
This works well for most applications, but if you want to be more explicit, 
you can optionally pass a `chat_id` query parameter.
