So, now that we've established why you may want to personalize your app,
let's see how SID enables you to do so.

## The API
SID is targeted at applications which use langugage models
to process and generate text. 
Because one of the key benefits of language models
is the ability to extract information from unstructured data (such as text),
SID does not attempt to impose a specific data model on the user.

Instead, most of the API is centered around text chunks,
which are simply strings of text with some metadata attached to them.
These are intended to be fed into a language model, which will then
produce the final output.
Chunks are created by retrieving text from the various data sources that a user has configured.

### Query Endpoint
The main endpoint of the API is the `/query` endpoint. 
Given a query string,
it retrieves text chunks whose content is relevant to the query.
These can then be used to generate the final, personalized, output.

## Where does the data actually come from?
