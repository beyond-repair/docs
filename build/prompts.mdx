## Basics
Even though we're always doing our best to find the most relevant matches to any query,
it can sometimes happen that the results are not exactly what you're looking for.

If you simply feed all results into the model along with the user's query,
the model may have a hard time discerning what is relevant from what isn't,
and will oftentimes try to incorporate the irrelevant results into the generated text.

For this reason, it is important to specify in your prompt that only results
that are clearly relevant to the user's query should be used in the generated text,
and that other results can be safely ignored.

## Example
In our [demo](https://demo.sid.ai), we append the following prompt to the user's query,
along with the results returned by SID:
```
The following results might help you answer the next user query
```
Importantly, the prompt specifies that the results only *might* be relevant to the query,
and that they not necessarily are.
