title: 'Revoking Access'
description: 'Allow your users to disconnect their SID account from your application'
---
## Overview
A user may wish to disconnect their SID account from your application, for example, if they want to use a different account.
You can allow your users to do this by requesting the revocation of the tokens that were issued to your application.

For this, the `/oauth/revoke` endpoint is used. It accepts a json body containing your application's `client_id`, `client_secret`, and the `token` to be revoked.
The following example shows how to do this in Node.js using the [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) library.

```js
let refreshToken = /* database query / session / etc. */;

const data = {
	client_id: process.env.SID_CLIENT_ID,
	client_secret: process.env.SID_CLIENT_SECRET,
	token: refreshToken,
}

await axios.post('https://auth.sid.ai/oauth/revoke', data);
```
<Info>
When a token is revoked, all other tokens belonging to the same user account are also revoked.
</Info>
A revocation should be triggered when requested by the user, for example, by clicking a button in your application.
Our pre-built [React component](/auth/button) can be used for this purpose.

To reconnect their account, the user will have to go through the [authorization flow](/auth/flow) again.
