## Token Types
As part of the authorization process, you will encounter three types of secrets: Access Tokens, Refresh Tokens, and Authorization Codes. 
This section will explain the differences between these, as well as related best practices.

### Access Tokens
Access tokens are the keys to the kingdom. 
Once a user has authenticated and authorized your application, the authorization server will issue an access token. 
This token is used to make requests to the SID API on behalf of the user. 
Access tokens are short-lived and expire after a certain period of time.
<Info>
It makes sense to cache access tokens in your application, for example in a Redis cache.
</Info>

### Refresh Tokens
Refresh tokens are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires. 
Instead of forcing the user to authenticate again, the application can use the refresh token to get a new access token. 

The below example shows how to use a refresh token to obtain a new access token, using Node.js.
```js
let refreshToken = /* database query */;

const data = {
    grant_type: 'refresh_token',
    client_id: process.env.SID_CLIENT_ID,
    client_secret: process.env.SID_CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirect_uri: process.env.SID_REDIRECT_URL,
    refresh_token: refreshToken,
};
const response = await axios.post('https://auth.sid.ai/oauth/token', data);
const { access_token } = response.data;
```
<Info>
Refresh tokens are long-lived and should be stored securely, for example in a database.
</Info>

### Authorization Codes
As discussed in the section on the (authorization flow)[/auth/flow], when a user authorizes your application, 
the authorization server will issue an authorization code and call the `redirect_uri` that you specified in the authorization request.
You must then exchange the code for an access token and a refresh token. 
The authorization code is only used once and is immediately expired once it has been exchanged for tokens. 
<Warning>
The authorization code is not the same as the access token, and should _not_ be stored in your application.
Its only use is to immediately exchange it for tokens.
</Warning>
