The OAuth2.0 authentication flow is a standard protocol for allowing users to connect their accounts from one application to another.
SID uses this protocol to securely give your application access to the user's SID account.
It involves the following general steps:

1. **Authorization Link:** 
In your application, the user clicks an authorization link which takes them to their SID account to authenticate.

2. **Redirect:** 
After the user logs in and grants access permissions to your application, SID redirects them back to your application with an authorization code. 
They are redirected to a previously specified URI, such as `https://example.com/api/sid/callback`. 
This URI is specific to your application, and you can configure it in the [SID developer dashboard](https://app.sid.ai).

3. **Tokens Issued:** 
Your application makes a POST request to SID's token endpoint with the authorization code,
client ID, and client secret, and receives an access token and refresh token in response.

Once you have the access token, you can use it to make requests to the SID API on behalf of the user.
