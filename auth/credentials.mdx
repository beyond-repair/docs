title: 'Client Credentials'
description: 'Identify your application to the API'
---
## Overview
To go through the [authorization flow](/auth/flow) you need to identify your application to the API. 
This is done by providing a client ID and a client secret. 

Currently, these are provided to you by the API team. 
In the future, you will be able to create your own applications and manage their credentials through the developer dashboard.

## Example
Below is an example of a client credentials object, as it will be provided to you by us.
```json
{
  "client_name": "Foo corp.",
  "client_id": "abcdefg1234567890",
  "client_secret": "my-secret-key",
  "redirect_uris": [
    "https://example.com/api/callback/sid",
    "http://localhost:3000/api/callback/sid"
  ],
  "client_secret_expires_at": 0
}
```
Throughout these docs, we assume that these values are stored in the following environment variables:
| Enviroment Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SID_CLIENT_ID`       | `client_id` |
| `SID_CLIENT_SECRET`   | `client_secret` |
| `SID_REDIRECT_URI`    | One of the URIs in `redirect_uris` |
