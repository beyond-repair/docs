title: 'Client Credentials'
description: 'Identify your application to the API'
---
## Overview
To go through the [authorization flow](/auth/flow) you need to identify your application to the API. 
This is done by providing a client ID and a client secret. 

Currently, these are provided to you by the API team. 
In the future, you will be able to create your own applications and manage their credentials through the developer dashboard.

## Authorization URL
The authorization URL is the URL that you will redirect your users to, to start the authorization flow.
For each redirect URI that you provide, you will be given a unique authorization URL. 
It is important that you use the correct authorization URL for each redirect URI.

## Example
Below is an example of a client credentials object, as it will be provided to you by us.
```json
{
  "client_id": "abcdefg1234567890",
  "client_secret": "my-secret-key",
  "redirect_uris": [
    "https://example.com/api/callback/sid",
    "http://localhost:3000/api/callback/sid"
  ],
  "authorization_urls": [
    "https://me.sid.ai/api/auth/login?returnTo=bGthanNoZG...",
    "https://me.sid.ai/api/auth/login?returnTo=MzQ7b2lbZa..."
  ]
}
```
Throughout these docs, we assume that these values are stored in the following environment variables:
| Enviroment Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SID_CLIENT_ID`       | `client_id` |
| `SID_CLIENT_SECRET`   | `client_secret` |
| `SID_REDIRECT_URI`    | One of the URIs in `redirect_uris` |
| `SID_AUTHORIZATION_URL` | The corresponding URL in `authorization_urls` |

Make sure that, for a given redirect URI, you use the corresponding authorization URL.
